Abstract
-A GAN model is developed to automatically generate
Monet style images from photos. The generator is trained
using a discriminator. Since machines have limited contextual
performance, we plan to improve upon the discrimination performance by incorporating a human component for a better visual
judgement. Human inputs on the similarity to Monet painting,
strokes, colours, and style of the image are collected in a gamied
fashion to motivate user participation.
## Introduction
Computer vision and image processing have signicantly
developed in recent years and are used in a plethora of applications. Several main directions of elaboration and application
of computer vision could be highlighted, including, but not
limited to, image recognition, analysis, and processing.
This work focuses on the task of implementing image processing, based on a Kaggle competition titled "I'm something
of a Painter Myself". This competition poses a question if
data science approaches can be used to trick art lovers, and
help them to think out of the box in terms of arts of famous
artists. Precisely speakin g, the goal of the competition is to
use a suitable machine learning pipeline to train a network
that could eventually be used for generating (reprocessing)
images in Monet style.
For this challenge, a generative adversarial network (GAN)
is used for altering arbitrary input images to match the style
of Monet paintings. Thus, it will will be challenging, at the
rst glance, to discover whether an output is indeed painting
of the artist or not. Our model is comprised of two parts:
generator
and
discriminator
. The generator is trained using
a discriminator.
A secondary goal is to add a human component for discrimination of the images, in addition to the machine discriminator.
The motivation of incorporating the human inputs is threefold: (i) extending the dataset; (ii) making images visually
more discernible; and (iii) collecting contextual data regarding
strokes, colours, and style of the generated images to help
improve the performance of the system. Thus, we let users
share their inputs, regarding the accuracy of the generated
images, in a subjective fashion, besides yes/no answers of
whether an image is Monet or not.
As with any human competition system, users are incentivized to participate in the improvement of the training using
the following:

Giving the opportunity for users to participate in the
training in a gamied way;

Motivating users in a way that they can use the engineered
application to test their knowledge of Monet's style;

Allowing various community-based interactions and competitions;

Providing star-ratings and store rewards for users for
stimulating users' activity in the application.

Firstly the term "Generative Adversarial Networks" was
introduced in 2014 in the scientic paper of Ian Goodfellow
et. al [1]. Since that time the eld of GANs development
has expanded. In this paper CycleGAN is considered as the
main approach for solving the dened problem, which already
showed the efciency in other similar tasks [2]. Still there are
also other implementations of GANs that can be reviewed.
Thus, PixelRNN [5] is an instance of auto-regressive Generative model. GANs learn implicit probability distribution. In
comparison with GANs, auto-regressive models, in their turn,
learn explicit data distribution. There is an implementation of
GANs as StyleGAN [4] where the idea is a construction of
a stack of layers so that base layers generate low-resolution
pictures and subsequent layers consistently improve the resolution.
Indeed intriguing example of GAN performance is presented
in DiscoGAN which allows to dene cross-domain relations
on unsupervised data [7]. As for people it is quite easily to
understand for a pair of domains what is what, what is the
pictures of shoes or bags, the implementation of this type
of GANs is challenging. Also entertaining GAN construction
is presented in a paper of S. Reed et. al [6]. The model
receives as an input textual description of the image which
contains various photos of birds and owers and then generates
an image with it's features that was dened in the textual
description before.
To sum up, all of the mentioned GAN models have Discriminator and Generator that try to cheat each other and follow the
approach of adversarial loss. Applications are diverse, starting
with generation of modied photos with special effect and
ending with generation of the image basing the input text.

In this section, we described the data types, their formats,
and pre-processing pipeline.
### Data Type and FormatData are digital three-channel JPEG-encoded RGB images.
Each channel is a
2
D
matrix, which is resized to have a
uniform size of
256
x
256
. The data are divided into two sets
of images before training:
1) Set 1 comprises a total of 300 original Monet paintings,
which are provided by the competition. This set is used
for training the model.
2) Set 2 comprises about 70 00 sample photos. The
learnt
Monet-style is applied to these images, and results are
subsequently used for evaluation.
Fig. 1 shows histograms of three sample images. The
histograms are obtained by adding the three color channels
and then normalizing them.
Fig. 1: Sample images and their histograms are shown. The
histograms are obtained from the normalizing sum of three
color (RGB) channels.
### Software LibrariesAs a base language for analysis of the data, including data
preprocessing, creation, model estimation and results visualization, Python language, with its widely known libraries,
is used. For example, PyTorch is utilized to implement the
described CycleGAN model. Numpy is used to perform algebraic operations on matrices and standard auxiliary operations.
Pandas is employed to clean and preprocess the dataset. For
visualization purposes, Matplotlib and Seaborn packages are
used. Lastly, the collaborative interface design tool
Figma
is
used for creating UI interface demo, which will be used as a
basement for developing the application to get user's inputs
for subsequent model improvement.
Our preprocessing pipeline consisted of two stages, namely,
data preprocessing and augmentation, each of which are described below.
### Data PreprocessingThe data are preprocessed before training. This is to ensure
that input are normalized and cropped to a uniform same
size and are ready for the training. We also converted the
images into TensorFlow supported TFRecord format, which
is a simple format way of storing records such as the image
data. TFRecord is also considered as a more efcient storage
container since not only it saves data using the less space than
the original data but also allows them to be partitioned into
multiple les. We converted RGB images into uint8 tensors,
to support processing of the image data into the TensorFlow
pipeline.
D. Data Augmentation
The purpose of data augmentation is two-fold. First, we
want to extend our image database to include modied versions of the provided images. Secondly, we also want to make
our training more robust by using variations of the input
images. We performed two of the most common data augmentation tools, namely, image rotation and random mirroring.

### GAN ArchitectureThe goal of the generative adversarial network is to generate
new samples of data that would, ideally, have the same
distribution as the training set. In order to achieve this, the
GAN architecture uses two distinct networks Generator and
Discriminator. These networks can be viewed as
agents
that
play game against each other.
A generative network tries to
generate
data and a discriminator network
examines
data and estimates whether the generated sample is real or fake [1]. The generator takes random
noise as input and tries to generate sample images, which later,
along with original images, is fed to a discriminator network.
The goal of the generator is to generate images in a way that
will make the discriminator network unable to distinguish fake
and real images. As both players get better and better over
time, eventually generator is forced to create data that is as
realistic as possible. Hence, both the networks play a zero sum
game.
In the beginning, the generator does not know how to create
images that resemble the ones from the training set. Similarly,
the discriminator does not know how to categorize the images.
As a result, the discriminator receives two very different sets
of images. One is composed of
true
images from the training
set, and another batch contains
noisy
signals. As training
progresses, the generator tries to learn the data distribution that
is composed of the training set images. It then starts to output
images that look closer to the images from the training set.
3
Meanwhile, the discriminator network also starts to get better
at classifying samples as
real
or
fake
. As a consequence, the
two types of mini-batches begin to look similar, in structure,
to one another. That, as a result, makes the discriminator able
to identify images as real or fake.
### CycleGAN ArchitectureIn this project, our aim is not just generating images similar
to Monet's painting but also to transfer it to non-Monet images.
Thus the architecture of GAN is such that we can apply neural
style transfer to any
new
input image given to the system. As
discussed above, we un-pair images of two different domains
(
X ; Y
)
. The goal of the model is to translate an image from
X
to
Y
domain. Consequently, the model needs to learn the
mapping
G
:
X
!
Y
, such that the distribution of images
from
G
(
X
)
is indistinguishable from the distribution of
Y
using an adversarial loss. However, there are innitely many
such translations that will output same distribution over
y
. In
addition, this procedure often leads to map all input images
to the same output and optimization fails.
To overcome this issue, a Cycle-GAN (Fig. 2) is proposed.
The main idea of Cycle-GAN architecture is to exploit the
property that translation should be "cycle consistent", in the
sense that if we translate a sentence from English to German
and then translate it back to English, we should arrive back
at the original sentence [2]. Mathematically, if we have a
mapping
G
:
X
!
Y
and another mapping
F
:
Y
!
X
,
then
G
and
F
should be inverses of each other. CycleGAN
utilizes this assumption by training both the mappings
G
and
F
simultaneously, and adding a cycle consistency loss that
encourages
F
(
G
(
x
)) =
x
and
G
(
F
(
y
)) =
y :
Combining
this loss with adversarial losses on domains
X
and
Y
yields
our full objective for unpaired image-to-image translation, as
shown in Eq. 1.

The Kaggle competition was intended to evaluate submissions based on Memorization - informedFID
MiFID score
,
which is a modication from Fr
¬¥
echet Inception Distance (FID).
For the evaluation metric, we utilize MiFID, in addition
to using human inputs in the feedback loop. FID evaluates
generated fake samples based on the statistics of a collection
of synthetic images compared to the statistics of real images
from the training set [3]. FID is calculated using the following
formula:

stand

Fig. 3: MiFID evaluation metric.
It can be observed from Fig. 3, the MiFID score uses a
memorization score in combination with FID. In this case, the
memorization score is a
cosine distance
between generated
image features and real image features. MiFID score of
0
represents that the generated and real images are the same.
Thus, the lower the MiFID score, the more the similarity
between two domains.

Due to limited time, lack of computational power, and
small memory size of currently available machines, we could
do training only for
7
epochs with batch size
2
. In Google
Colab GPU service, training of each epoch takes about two
hours. However, even with the insufcient
amount
of training,
we achieved satisfying results, and the generated images are
mostly seen as Monet style by humans. Fig. 4 shows a sample
output of our latest model.
Mathematically speaking, at the end of training, we achieved
56.84 MiFID score, which can be considered as an average
score on the competition leaderboard results. However, Kaggle
has its own code and method for calculation of MiFID score,
so it may be slightly different in Kaggle's own evaluation.

Furthermore, we compared the initial losses which we
recorded in the beginning of training and the nal losses that
we got at the end of training. Fig. 5 shows the loss functions'
values. It can be seen that the losses are decreased signicantly
with during training. However, as a future work, the network
can be trained for more epochs to let model weights reach
their optimal values.

Fig. 6 shows the home page of GUI that mainly focuses on
the human computation part. Gamication is used to gather
more data through human response to extend the data set. The
GUI is currently implemented on an IOS (iPhone 10) based
application. The homepage of the GUI contains 3 clickable
interfaces - "Upload Picture", "Play game" and "About", each
of which are discussed below in detail.
### Upload PictureBy using the interface "upload picture", users can browse
through the pictures and generate the Monet-version of the
picture using the model mentioned above. The users can also
browse through their own galleries to select the desired picture
and "Monet-ise" it, based on the aforementioned model. Fig. 6
provides a UI to browse though the gallery.
### Play GameFig. 7 shows the user interface of the mini game that users
can play. This game is for the purpose of gathering data using
human computation component. The user are asked different
questions to extend our existing dataset. For example, the
question "Is the picture an original Monet or not" will generate
a binary response. Based on this response, the user can be
asked more advanced questions, in a questionnaire format,
about the strokes of the brush, color, shape or texture of the
painting. The users can further select the part of the painting
where they think the painting looks fake or doesn't follow the
style of Monet. The game will be based on a point system. For
each painting that the users correctly label as fake or original,
the game will award a certain set of points to the users.
### AboutThe about interface gives the information about our model
and the game in general for the more curious users looking to

As the results show, the GAN network is able to successfully
transform the input photos into a Monet style painting. The
user interface of the app enables us to extend our data set
using the principle of human computation. Gamication is
used as an incentive to gather the data which will essentially
ne tune the model further once integrated. Training of the
model for a longer period will generate better results and can
be implemented in the near future. This model can also be
applied to generate paintings in the style of other celebrated
artists, which provides more depth to the model and adds
multiple use cases for future research.
